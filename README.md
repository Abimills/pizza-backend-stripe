# pizza-backend-stripe
I developed a robust backend for a pizza ordering website using Node.js and Express.js, seamlessly integrating Stripe for secure payment processing. This backend handles user authentication, order management, and real-time order updates, ensuring a smooth and secure ordering experience for customers. With Node.js and Express.js, I've created a scalable and efficient system that allows the website to handle a high volume of orders while providing a seamless integration with Stripe for secure and hassle-free payments.
